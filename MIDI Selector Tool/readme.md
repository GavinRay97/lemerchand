## MIDI Selection Tool v1.2.1b

![Demo](https://t2361428.p.clickup-attachments.com/t2361428/3f5587aa-833f-4cab-8b80-c9cc140aa938/dem.gif?view=open)

**Description:**

A tool for quickly selecting midi notes in REAPER. Filters for events such as:
		
		- Note Range
		- Pitch (including scales!)
		- Min/Max Velocity 
		- Note length (no dotted yet)
		- Beat position in 16th notes (sorry--no odd time signatures)

**Cool Features:**
		- Save your favorite settings into presets!
		- Right-click "Select" to restrict to the time selection
		- Shift-click "Select" to invert the filter
		- Right-click 'Clear' for a global reset
		- Drag over beats/pitches to 'draw' patterns quickly
		- Right-click a control to reset it
		- Click 'Capture' to set the parameters dfrom the currently selected notes!
		- Shift-click a control to set it's parameters to currently selected notes.
		- Shift-click a beat for a preset. Shift-right click to store in that slot.
		- Ctrl-click and drag velocity slider to move note range
		- Built-in documentation (hoverr over a control for info!)
		- Adjustable threshold for length/grid detection in PPQ

**Known Issues**

		- Entering an invalid note range isn't error-handled
		- Some issues might occure with saving.
			- If they do, simply reload the default config (Right-click "Save" under "Settings")

**Some things I want to add:**

		- Inclusive selection
		- Info on selected notes displayed (eg., how many notes were selected)
