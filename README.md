## MIDI Selection Tool v.75b*

Select any note within a take or time selection (latter feature coming soon) based on a number of parameters including:
		-
		- Note Range
		- Pitch
		- Velocity 
		- Beat position in 16th notes


**Cool Features:**
		- Right-click any UI element to reset any individual section (eg., 'Pitch,' 'Velocity,' 'Beats')
		- Right-click (or type SHIFT - BACKSPACE) the 'Clear' button to unselect all notes and reset ALL filters
		- Load one of 6 preset beat patterns using the 'A,' 'B,' and 'C' buttons (Right-click for a second preset)
			          - Modifications to a preset persist until the srcipt closes
		- Help-text on mouse hover

**Known Issues**
		- Entering an invalid note range isn't checked so make sure you give it a good value until I fix it
		- Inclusive select only works with velocity
		- Delete and Time selection are not yet implemented
		- My code is messy

**Some things I want to add:**
		- The ability to store user-defined beat presets in a file 
		- The ability to select notes only in time-selection, or already selected
		- Pitch presets based on scales
		- Info on selected notes displayed (eg., how many notes were selected)
